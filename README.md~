The included index.html file is ready to go. Just load it into a browser as a file or with a web server.
If you modify the code, you will need to run the following code from your terminal:

```javascript
npm install
webpack
```
"npm install" installs a "node_modules" directory. After that, all you need to run is "webpack". Webpack loads everything you need into a file named "bundle.js" which is installed in "index.html". After that, you are good to go.

If you move "index.html" to a new location, be sure to take the script file "bundle.js" with it.

A development server is included in this repository, so you can view the buttons on port 8080 by entering:

```javascript
webpack-dev-server
```
Commentary is included with the running app. More will be included here as time permits.
